0. Read Jeff's PhD thesis. Julia's heart/subtyping algorithm still freakin' hyerogliphical.
Will return.

 0.5 Ran Valgrind on all Julia, ValidatedNumerics.jl, and TaylorSeries.jl source code.
 No memleaks. Nice.

#1. @ChrisRackaukas Bikeshedding - arguing about syntax

"""
#The term was coined as a metaphor to illuminate Parkinsonâ€™s Law of Triviality. Parkinson observed that a committee whose job is to approve plans for a nuclear power plant may spend the majority of its time on relatively unimportant but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bikeshed, while neglecting the design of the power plant itself, which is far more important but also far more difficult to criticize constructively. It was popularized in the Berkeley Software Distribution community by Poul-Henning Kamp[1] and has spread from there to the software industry at large.

2. tests might be "bleeding"
i.e. one test is setting a value that changes another test.

3. The fantastic @ChrisRackaukas post on [Software Engineering practices](http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/finalizing-julia-package-documentation-testing-coverage-publishing/) for Julia.

4. [Github hooks](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/05/13/048744.full.pdf) (in Rule 5) are scripts that run everytime a push happens, so that Continuous Integration and Testing can happen. Travis CI for UNIX, Appveyor for UNIX.

5. Use Digital Object Identifiers to cite source code/databases. Zenodo is recommended, or Figshare.

6. Use Gists that are secret from search engines!
