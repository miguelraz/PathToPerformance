<A NAME="LICENSE"> <H2>LICENSE</H2> </A>
The files in this directory and all subdirectories are licensed to you according to the file <A HREF="LICENSE.txt">LICENSE.txt</A>
(which resides in the same directory as this file),
with the following exception:
<UL>
	<LI>Files in <TT>src/bzip2/</TT> are under different licenses.  
            See <A HREF="src/bzip2/index.html#license">src/bzip2/index.html</A> for the applicable licenses.

The subdirectories in <A href="src/index.html">src/</A> contain source code for some examples from the book:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<EM><A HREF="http://parallelbook.com/">Structured Parallel Programming</A></EM>.
	<BR>by Michael McCool, Arch Robison, and James Reinders.
	<BR>published by Morgan Kaufman, July 2012.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
As a bonus, this package provides extra code:
<UL>
<LI>Serial or TBB equivalents to Cilk Plus code that, for space reasons, were not fully shown in the book.
<LI>Auxilary routines mentioned in passing by the book.
<LI>Harnesses for testing and/or timing the code.
</UL>

<HR>
<A NAME="Prerequisites"><H2>Prerequisites</H2></A>
This section lists prerequisite software required to build and run the examples.

<H3>Compiler</H3> 

To compile all of the examples requires a compiler supporting:
<UL>
<LI> Cilk Plus
<LI> OpenMP 3.0 or later
<LI> C++11 lambda expressions 
</UL>
Currently supported compilers are:
<TABLE BORDER="1">
	<TH> Compiler </TH><TH>Comment</TH>
	<TR>
		<TD>Intel C++ compiler, version 13.0 or later</TD><TD>Version 13.0 or later can compile all of the examples.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>g++ 4.5.1 or later</TD><TD>Cannot compile Cilk Plus examples.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>gcc 4.7 <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/branches/cilkplus/">branch</A> with Cilk Plus</TD><TD>Should be able to compile all of the examples</A>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Visual Studio 2010 or later</TD><TD>Can compile only the TBB examples.</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
Conditional compilation directives will automatically omit code that these compilers cannot handle.

<H3>Libraries</H3>

You need Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB), because the examples use TBB's portable <TT>tbb::tick_count</TT> to do timing.
TBB is distributed with the Intel compiler, and or <A HREF="http://threadingbuildingblocks.org">open-source</A> version can be downloaded.
The makefiles assume your environment is set up so that your compiler can find the TBB include files and run-time library.
On Linux and MacOS, you can do this setup by running the script <TT>tbb/bin/tbbvars.sh</TT> or sourcing the script <TT>tbb/bin/tbbvars.csh</TT>,
depending on which shell you are using.  Those scripts are part of TBB and not part of this package.
<P>
The Cholesky Factorization example requires a Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) library.
See <A href="src/cholesky/index.html#BLAS">here</A> for details.

<H3>Other Tools</H3>

Linux and Mac OS systems typically have the other prerequisites.  
Windows users may have to acquire a few extra tools:
<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR>
<TD> GNU make </TD><TD> GNU make is required to build the examples.</TD>
<TR>
    <TD>Python</TD><TD> Required to run the top-level Makefile that builds all the examples.
                        Python is not required for building individual examples.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<HR>
<A NAME="Build-Run"><H2>Building and Running</H2></A>

NOTE: The timing part of the harnesses typically try only one particular kind and distribution of data, 
so the timings are not necessarily representative of other situations.

<H3><A NAME="Makefile">Using Makefiles</H3>

Makefiles are provided.  
They should work on Linux, Mac OS, or Windows.
They include <A HREF="config/config.inc">config/config.inc</A>, which describes the compiler options to be used.
Near the top of this file is a choice of lines that set CPLUS.
Uncomment the one that matches your compiler.
<P>
The top level Makefile in this directory does the same action for all examples.
The supported actions are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR>
    <TH>Command</TH><TH>Effect</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><TT>make run</TT></TD><TD>Run all examples.  Builds any examples that are not yet built.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><TT>make build</TT></TD><TD>Build all examples</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><TT>make clean</TT></TD><TD>Remove all binaries and object files</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
These commands can be applied to a single example, say <EM>foo</EM>, by:
<OL>
<LI> cd to <TT>src/</TT><EM>foo</EM>/<TT>*/build/</TT></LI>.
<LI> Run <TT>make</TT> there.
</OL>

<H3>Using Windows 2010 Solutions</H3>

On Microsoft Windows, you can use either Makefiles or Visual Studio 2010 solutions.
See previous section on how to use the Makefiles.
<P>
The Visual Studio 2010 solutions are set up to use the Intel C++ XE 12.1 Toolset.
To build and run an example <EM>foo</EM>, 
open the solution file <TT>src\<EM>foo</EM>\msvs\test_<EM>foo</EM>.sln</TT>.
If the paths to TBB needs to be changed, edit the setting for TBB_ROOT in <A href="config/msvs.props">config\msvs.prop</A>.
