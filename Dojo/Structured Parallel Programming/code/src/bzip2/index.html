<H1>Bzip2 Data Compression</H1>

The subdirectories herein contain parallel versions of bzip2 
as described in Chapter 12 of the <A HREF="http://parallelbook.com/">book</A>.
<P>
This version of bzip2 is for demonstration purposes only.
It has not been validated.

<H2>Building</H2>
To simplify building, all object files are compiled into the final program(s), 
instead of building a separate library first as in the original bzip2 distribution.
<P>
The <TT>Makefile</TT> in subdirectory<TT>build/</TT> comes ready to build the TBB version.
To build the Cilk Plus version, you will need to edit the top of the Makefile
to set <TT>MODEL=cilkplus</TT> instead of <TT>MODEL=tbb</TT>.

<H2>Usage</H2>

For testing, we recommend using an input file that is approximately 250 Megabytes.
One way to obtain such a file is to use the <EM>ngram</EM> tool  in <A href="ngram/ngram.cpp">ngram/ngram.cpp</A>.
Here is a sample invocation of the tool that generates a 250 Megabyte file <TT>foo.txt</TT>
from the training file A href="ngram/model.txt"><TT>ngram/alice.txt</TT></A>.
<PRE>
    ngram.exe 250000000 alice.txt foo.txt
</PRE>
<P>
Here is a sample command line for invoking the Cilk Plus version of bzip2:  
<PRE>
    bzip2-cilkplus -9 &lt;foo.txt &gt;foo.bz2
</PRE>
Be sure to have both the input and output files on a local filesystem,
otherwise performance will likely be I/O bound.
We recommend using the option -9, 
which specifies that very large blocks should be used, 
so that parallel scheduling overheads can be well amortized.
<P>
To decompress a file:
<PRE>
    bzip2-cilkplus -d &lt;foo.bz2 &gt;bar.txt
</PRE>
Then you can check that <TT>foo.txt</TT> and <TT>bar.txt</TT> are identical.
<P>
You can set the number of threads used by the Cilk Plus or TBB versions 
by setting <TT>CILK_NWORKERS</TT> or <TT>TBB_NWORKERS</TT> respectively.  
For example, using bash:  
<PRE>
    export TBB_NWORKERS=2
</PRE>
makes the TBB version use 2 threads.

<H2>Listings</H2>

The files containing Listing 12.2 and 12.3 are adapted from the original bzip2, 
and thus contain <EM>much</EM> more than those listings.
