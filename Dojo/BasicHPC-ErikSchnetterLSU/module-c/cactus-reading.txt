An overview over the Cactus framework and its design principles. These
principles hold for many other frameworks for scientific simulations
as well. I strongly recommend reading this article.



Michael T. Heath,
Scientific Computing: An Introductory Survey
McGraw-Hill, New York, ISBN 0-07-239910-4
<http://www.cse.illinois.edu/heath/scicomp/>

This book gives an introduction to the mathematics of scientific
computing, which is elsewhere also called "numerical analysis". In
this, it goes far beyond what is needed for this course. At the same
time, it does not cover any of the more advanced software aspects
covered in this course. You are welcome to browse a copy of the book
in my office.



Cactus Users' Guide:

This guide gives an introduction to the Cactus Software Framework, and
explains how to use it and how to program with it.
<http://www.cactuscode.org/documentation/UsersGuide.pdf>, parts A
(Installation and Running) and B (Application thorn writing). See also
other information available from <http://www.cactuscode.org/>.



Einstein Toolkit Tutorial for New Users:

This tutorial contains step-by-step instructions for installing and
running the Einstein Toolkit, a Cactus-based application, on Queen
Bee, a supercomputer in Baton Rouge.
<http://docs.einsteintoolkit.org/et-docs/Tutorial_for_New_Users>. This
tutorial is part of your homework.
