Exam questions for Module C:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What determines the accuracy of a simulation? List at least two
   ways in which the accuracy be improved.

Possible answers:

The accuracy is influenced by:
- approximations in choosing the PDEs that are simulated
- approximations in the initial or boundary conditions
- the discrete resolution

The accuracy can be improved by using more faithful systems of PDEs,
by using better initial conditions, and by increasing the discrete
resolution.

2. What is MPI, and what is it used for? Assume there are two
   processes, and process A needs to access an array element stored on
   process B. Schematically, how does this work?

Possible answer:

MPI is the "Message Passing Interface" standard. It is used to
parallelise applications, in particular on distributed memory systems.

MPI works by letting processes send and receive messages. These
processes are otherwise independent, and they cannot see each other's
data.

If process A needs to access an array element stored on process B,
this can be implemented as follows:

1. process A sends the array index to process B
2. process B receives the array index from process A
3. process B looks up the array element locally
4. process B sends the array element to process A
5. process A receives the array element form process B

3. What is a software framework? Name one software framework, and give
   at least three characteristic elements of a software framework.

Possible answer:

A software framework is a way to structure large applications into a
set of smaller, manageable components.

One software framework is Cactus.

Characteristics of a software framework are:
- Used in large-scale applications, often developed/maintained by a
  large, international team
- Applications are built from components, which are developed by the
  framework user
- Framework itself performs no work, only glues components together
- End user (not programmer) combines components into application
- Control inversion: main program is part of framework, not user code
  (opposite of a library)

4. What are CCL files in Cactus? List which CCL files exist, and what
   they define.

Possible answer:

CCL files declare the interface of a Cactus component (thorn) to the
Cactus framework (flesh). There are three kinds of CCL files:
- interface.ccl: define thorn interitance structure and grid functions
- schedule.ccl:  specify when routines are called and storage is allocated
- param.ccl:     declare the thorn's run-time parameters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. What tools exist to support code development in large, distributed,
   international collaborations? Name at least five such tools.

Possible answers:
- email
- chat (AIM, Skype)
- repositories (cvs, svn, git)
- wikis
- bug trackers
- telephone conferencing
- video conferencing (Skype, EVO)
- Google docs (live editing)
