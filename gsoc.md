# GSoC goals:

- [ ] Refactor ODEqs and SDEqs into DiffEqDiffTools
- [ ] Unit tests for PRs into DiffEqDiffTools

- [ ] Read tests and get on implementing ODEs as test cases



# Examples to do:

- [ ] Work through Euler (May9 discussion, DiffEq lobby) and Jacobians



- [ ] [fempoisson example](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/tutorials/fempoisson_example.html)

# Stretch goals

- [ ] Complex autodifferentiation for physics - so then it probably can be a straightforward application of ForwardDiff to build those equations from a Hamiltonian
- Euler-Langrange
- he'll need to dig into how the diffeq functions are differenitated which is all about handling closures and that jazz it's the same idea to differentiate H(p,q) so that would be a good exercise then the internals would make a lot more sense.
