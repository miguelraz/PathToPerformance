# GSoC '17

## GSoC goals:

- [ ] Refactor ODEqs and SDEqs into DiffEqDiffTools
- [ ] Unit tests for PRs into DiffEqDiffTools
- [ ] Review JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl#159
- [ ] Refactor JuliaDiffEq/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl@8318c0f
* The abstraction of the Shampine Matlab ODE Suite paper is the key goal for project. [Many things spring off from this.](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Math128/ODEsuite.pdf)
- [ ] Read tests and get on implementing ODEs as test cases

### Pre-GSoC - Community bonding time
- [ ] Know who people are, what the repos and packages are, know them as a user.
- [ ] List 30 packages, people,
- [ ] JuliaDiff
- [ ] ForwardDiff.jl
- [ ] Calculus.jl
- [ ] OrdinaryDiffEq.jl
- [ ] StochasticDiffEq.jl


## Examples to do:

- [ ] Work through Euler (May9 discussion, DiffEq lobby) and Jacobians

- [ ] [UCIDataScienceInitiative](http://ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io/IntroToJulia/) Projects and such

- [ ] [fempoisson example](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/tutorials/fempoisson_example.html)

- [ ] DevDocs use case and walkthrough

## Stretch goals

- [ ] Complex autodifferentiation for physics - so then it probably can be a straightforward application of ForwardDiff to build those equations from a Hamiltonian
- Euler-Langrange
- he'll need to dig into how the diffeq functions are differenitated which is all about handling closures and that jazz it's the same idea to differentiate H(p,q) so that would be a good exercise then the internals would make a lot more sense.

- [ ] Turbo DiffEqPhysics

- [ ] katthyat qmech

- [ ] shutz and misner

- [ ] wonsheok shin EM

- [ ] add old methods for didactic purposes

## Open problems:

- [ ] Connect well to LSODA

## Other GSoCs:

- [ ] @shivin9 - speed up elliptics PDEs

- [ ] Yannis - FEM

- [ ] Ying Bo - BVP

## Taking care of the little things:

- [ ] Typos in all DiffEqDocs et al

- [ ] Graph of DiffEq dependencies
