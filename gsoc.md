# GSoC goals:

- [] Refactor ODEqs and SDEqs into DiffEqDiffTools
- [] Unit tests for PRs into DiffEqDiffTools

[] Read tests and get on implementing ODEs as test cases



# Examples to do:

[] Work through Euler (May9 discussion, DiffEq lobby) and Jacobians

[] [fempoisson example](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/tutorials/fempoisson_example.html)

# Open problems:

[] Connect well to LSODA

[] Turbo DiffEqPhysics

[] katthyat qmech

[] shutz and misner

[] wonsheok shin EM

# Other GSoCs:

[] @shivin9 - speed up elliptics PDEs

[] Yannis - FEM

[] Ying Bo - BVP

# Taking care of the little things:

[] Typos in all DiffEqDocs et al

[] Graph of DiffEq dependencies
